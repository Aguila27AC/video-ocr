"Hey! Wanna hit up the karaoke place?"

00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,031
"The new Love & Hero song is out."

00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,033
"Hmm. % "

vy!

00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,037
"I'm not feeling up to-it today."

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,040
"This story creeped me out earlier."

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,041
"Do you want to hear it?"

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,046
"Oh? Sure."

13
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,049
"You remember Miss Yamaguchi?"

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,053
"She wears those big glasses."

"| heard she's gone missing."

00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,059
"What? No one knows where she is?"

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,062
"Nope. She just disappeared."

19
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,066
"Just up and poofed from the library."

20
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,072
"One of the student librarians said she was researching something there."

21
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,074
"But then she vanished,"

22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,078
"But she's super diligent, right?"

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,081
"One of the students thought it was weird that she'd up and leave like that,”

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,083
"So he checked in on her."

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,084
"So he checked in.on her."

26
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,085
"But when he did..."

27
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,095
"The only thing left...was her arm."

28
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:45,105
"It had her really weird scar on it, so it was definitely her arm..."

29
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,109
"A scar?"

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,112
"Yeah. It looked like a dog bite."

31
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,114
"She showed it to me once."

32
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,117
"She had no idea where it came from."

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,121
"For real?"

34
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,124
"There was a scar like that on Miki's leg, too..."

35
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,127
"Huh? Miki? Wait, that's..."

"The girl who went missing, yeah."

38
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,133
"That's crazy."

39
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
"Maybe that rumor is true..."

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
"The one about the cursed scar."

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,143
"Cut it out. You're scaring me..."

42
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,153
I hear snatches of an idiotic ghost story.

43
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:38,158
They're speaking seriously... But it's obvious they don't believe a word.

44
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,160
They're only killing time.

45
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:46,166
Rumors are the best way to do that.

46
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,170
The sun's about to set.

47
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,173
It's gotten later than I planned. I shouldn't have stuck around to hear that story,

48
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,175
It's gotten later than I planned. | shouldn't have stuck around to hear that story.

49
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,177
I better hurry.

50
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:20,200
Thunder rumbles in the distance.

A huge mansion is in front of me.

00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,218
My vision blurs. My ears are buzzing.

57
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:42,222
Ugh, my head's swimming. It's almost like I'm drunk.

58
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,225
What time is it?

59
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,228
I glance at my wrist, but my watch is gone,

60
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,230
Did I put it in my coat pocket...?

But all I find is a business card.

64
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,239
In elegant printed letters is a name.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,242
Saya Kujou Spirit Healer

66
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
On the back is a photo of the mansion.

67
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,248
I guess this must be Kujou Mansion then?

68
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,252
Kujou Mansion... Saya Kujou...

69
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254
Those names sound familiar somehow...

70
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,257
One way to find out.

71
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,260
Taking a deep breath, I reach out to knock.

72
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,263
I stop when I see something on my wrist.

73
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:40,280
It's a strange scar...

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,282
When did that...?

75
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,285
I could just be imagining this, but...

76
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,288
I feel an icy chill when I look at it.

77
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,290

My fist pounds on the door. No reply.
